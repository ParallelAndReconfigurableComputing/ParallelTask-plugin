I've also found a few minor annoyances with the ParaTask Eclipse plugin:
 

1.  It moves .ptjava files to the bin folder unless you manually filter
> them 

2.  It packages .ptjava files into .jar files (hence losing on some
> of the intellectual protection of merely distributing the .class files) 

3. It has on a few occasions messed with SVN since the ParaTask plugin
> changes files without the Eclipse SVN plugins knowledge so I've had two
> occasions where there were mismatches between local copy and what the
> Eclipse SVN plugin thought the local copy looked like
